    <h1>Our Mile Of Time</h1>
    <p>an art installation and a celebration of life and death, of our past and future.</p>

    <h2>The idea</h2>
    <p>
    Our Mile Of Time is our life on earth, our time being here, symbolized in a walkable art installation of 1 mile length. Our Mile Of Time is a walkable time axis of 1 mile length, starting in the year 1920 and ending with the year 2100. It creates a personal experience, a real life reference to our abstract model of our lifetime on earth. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Our Mile Of Time is an interactive installation, in the sense that everyone becomes an active part of the installation. Everyone is asked to answer 3 simple questions for himself. Where are you coming from, where are you now and where are you going to. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We look back into our past, into the history of our region, our tribe and our family to understand where we are coming from, to understand on what base we a staying in this moment here and now. Then we walk into our future, unwritten and to be created by our hands until the end of our journey, our end? How will that end look like and when will it be?

    <h2>The building part</h2>

<p>
The project is simple and complex. Basicly it means building an one mile long installation in a park, in a city, in the countryside. And then bring it to life.
</p>

<h3>When and where?</h3>
<p>
Where and when it will happen is open and should be open for now. With finding more supporters the project will grow. In this process we will find a place and time which fits best.
</p>
<p>
It could be as part of a bigger art show or festival, think about an art Biennial, a festival like fusion-festival in germany or burning man in Nevada. 
Or it could become a festival on it own
</p>

<h3>the many miles</h3>
<p>
As time and life has many aspects, so should Our Mile Of Time have many sides and colors. For every side and color the project needs supporters who will bring this to life. 
</p>

<p>
Some first ideas are to kick off your imagination are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a personal mile, a place to contemplate and stay for a longer time, look back in our family history, our history and future.</li>
  <li>a mile of sound, experience the history of music with songs from the last 80 years till today. What will the future sound like?  </li>
  <li>a playful mile, every 10 years theater improvisation .. </li>
  <li>a mile of light, during the night the mile will be illuminated in different colors, patterns.. </li>
  <li>a mile of stories, every 10 years one person will tell you his story or his future dream to come. </li>
  <li>a climate mile. Pile up mountains of coal correlating to the amount of co2 emission during the last 80 years, a red thick plastic line to symbolize the forecasted global warming, show tipping points </li>
  <li>a mile of history .. </li>
  <li>a mile of celebration and dance .. </li>
</ul>


<h2>Supporter and Builder</h2>
<p>We are looking for help to realize this big piece of art, without help this beautiful and powerful installation will stay a great idea, but will never live. If you know someone who could help in the process of realizing this project or you yourself can help realizing it,
